<h4 id="the-uks-economic-turmoil">The UK’s economic turmoil</h4>

<p>Negative effects of Brexit on British Economy:</p>

<p>The Geopolitical Tensions effect on the Economy of United Kingdom
The pound fell 12% in value immediately after the referendum results were announced, with the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar dropping to its lowest level since May 9, 1985. Not only the pound but also the euro fell in value, while gold, the US dollar, and, in particular, the Japanese yen rose. UK and EU economic growth has slowed. According to the OECD, the UK economy was down nearly 1.5% by 2018, the pound depreciated by 20%. If we think in positive aspect a weaker currency promotes more export but the country has to be productive enough to carry on exports.</p>

<p>When the United Kingdom exits the strong EU trade union, it faces significant risks of losing international power. Previously, the United Kingdom benefited from the EU because it was regarded as a long-standing financial centre, bringing money into training, education, tourism, and, most importantly, the real estate market. This assists the UK in attracting FDI, GDP growth, and good jobs. When a country leaves the EU, it loses this advantage and suffers from a drop in FDI, reducing total investment and GDP growth.</p>

<p>Foreign Direct Investments, Net Inflows as (% of GDP)</p>

The stock market in the United Kingdom also shook. Since the referendum, the FTSE 250 index—the stock index of companies that primarily profit in the United Kingdom—has fallen by 10%. Banks appear to be the organisations that are suffering the most. Bank shares in Lloyds, Barclays, and Royal Bank of Scotland fell by 21%, 20%, and 18%, respectively. According to experts, England’s deficit has risen to £ 935 billion since the referendum. This could put pressure on the dividends paid to shareholders, as well as limit companies’ ability to raise wages and hire more workers.</p>

<p>Brexit will make it more difficult for the best people in Europe to come to the UK to work. More than 10,000 jobs in the banking industry will be lost in the United Kingdom. Other industries, such as mechanics, construction, healthcare, and services, will suffer as a result of the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU. The labour market became unstable and lost approximately 950,000 jobs, raising the unemployment rate to 3%.</p>

<p>With the UK leaving the EU, free trade between European countries will be restricted and risky. Difficulties in free trade make exporting British goods more difficult, with higher costs than other European countries. According to experts, the United Kingdom may lose its AAA credit rating.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine war:</p>

<p>The impact of Russia and Ukraine war on energy crises due to sanctions and destroy of Nord pipeline has hit the EU and neighbouring countries hardly. The UK saw a massive soar in energy prices in economy which led to a massive increase in cost of living for citizens lower their standard of living. Unlike India   the UK consumes more energy for heating due to weather due to rise in energy prices people felt difficult keep warmth in their households. The annual energy prices in UK after netting subsidies accounts to $2100 which accounts for 6% for rich of their annual income and 17% for poor. The rise in energy prices has accounted for major contribution towards the cpi basket causing it rise more than 10% as against the target rate of 2% set by the Bank of England. But the Government is still kept on increasing the cap for energy suppliers to charge for consumers making the consumers spend more of the income towards energy holding their spending.</p>
